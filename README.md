YouTube Tooltipise Titles
=========================

I remember YouTube having `title` tooltips on video titles that would allow you to quickly preview the full title of a video. This feature seems to now have been removed.

This Google Chrome extension reintroduces `title` tooltips on video titles.


## Installation
Download the .crx file from the [release](https://github.com/teddywing/chrome-youtube-tooltipise-titles/releases) page and open the file in Chrome.
